# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
  movies = Location.create([{city: 'abuja'}, {city: 'london'}, {city: 'nairobi'},{city: 'new york'}, {city: "Abu Dhabi"}])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)
